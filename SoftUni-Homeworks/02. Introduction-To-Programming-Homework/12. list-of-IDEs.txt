Problem 12. Development Environments
•	Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with 
popular development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio.
•	Write in a text file called “list-of-IDEs.txt” at least five IDEs 
along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.

1.	Microsoft Visual Studio 

Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. 

It is used to develop computer programs for Microsoft Windows, as well as web sites, 
web applications and web services. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms
 such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and 
Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.
Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense.  
The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger. 
Other built-in tools include a forms designer for building GUI applications, web designer, 
class designer, and database schema designer.  Main IDE to be used for C# programming.

2.	MonoDevelop

MonoDevelop is an open source integrated development environment for Linux, OS X, and Windows. 
Its primary focus is development of projects that use Mono and .NET frameworks. 
MonoDevelop integrates features similar to those of NetBeans and Microsoft Visual Studio, 
such as automatic code completion, source control, a graphical user interface (GUI) and 
Web designer. MonoDevelop supports Boo, C, C++, C#, CIL, D, F#, Java, Oxygene, Python, Vala, 
and Visual Basic.NET.

3.	Morfik

Morfik, a set of visual designers, compilers and a Framework combined in an Integrated development
 environment (IDE) aimed at developing Ajax applications in a high-level language such as Java, 
C#, BASIC or Object Pascal. Morfik includes visual design tools for Web interfaces, 
database structure, and queries. It supports the classic client–server model, 
however like all Ajax applications, the client-side code runs within a browser. 
The Morfik development tool converts the forms that the user draws into DHTML, 
compiles the client-logic into JavaScript, and builds the application and 
database server engines to house the server-side code.

4.	SharpDevelop

SharpDevelop (also styled as #develop) is a free and open source integrated development environment
  for the .NET Framework, Mono, Gtk# and Glade# platforms. It supports development in C#,
Visual Basic .NET, Boo, F#, IronPython and IronRuby programming languages.

It was designed as a free and lightweight alternative to Microsoft Visual Studio, 
and contains an equivalent feature for almost every essential Visual Studio Express feature, 
including features for project management, code editing, application compiling and debugging. 
To allow for easy project migration, SharpDevelop works natively with Visual Studio project
 and code files. It is able to compile applications for .NET Framework 
version 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 and the .NET Compact Framework 2.0 and 3.5.

5.	Turbo C#
Turbo C# was an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from Borland that came in two versions, 
Explorer and Professional. It uses the C# programming language to develop applications 
for WinForms and ASP.NET.

6.	Eclipse
Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). It contains a base workspace 
and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Written mostly in Java, 
Eclipse can be used to develop applications. By means of various plug-ins, 
Eclipse may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages: Ada, ABAP, C, 
C++, COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Natural, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Python, 
R, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), and C# as well.

7.	NetBeans
NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing primarily with Java, 
but also with other languages, in particular PHP, C/C++, and HTML5. 
It is also an application platform framework for Java desktop applications and others.
