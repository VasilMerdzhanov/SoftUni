/* Problem 5 – Bit Flipper
We are given a bit sequence in the form of 64-bit integer. We pass through the bits from left to right and we flip 
 * all sequences of 3 equal bits (111  000, 000  111). For example, 8773276988229695713 represents 
 * the bit sequence 0111100111000000111100001111000000011111100010100011100011100001. We flip from left to right 
 * all 3 consecutive equal bits: 0111100111000000111100001111000000011111100010100011100011100001   
 * 0000100000111111000111100001111111000000011110111100011100011101. The obtained 64-bit number after flipping is 594226797558351645.
Your task is to write a program that enters a 64-bit integer, performs the above described flipping, and prints the obtained result as a 64-bit integer.
Input
The input data should be read from the console. It consists of a single 64-bit integer number.
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
Print at the console the 64-bit integer, representing the obtained bits after the flipping.
Constraints
•	The input number will be a 64-bit integer in the range [0 … 18 446 744 073 709 551 615].
